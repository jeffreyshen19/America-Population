# America-Population
A processing project which displays the United States population over time.

## How it Works
We took data from the United States Census (See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_historical_population#1790.E2.80.931860.2C_census_data)) and ran that through DataParser.java to create a spreadsheet that contained United States population data over time (data.csv). The graphics and visualization occured through Visualizer.pde.
